Onway AG offers WLAN and network access control solutions and software development. Their main fields of business are solutions for Network Access Control (NAC) as well as communication access for public transport. They are known for developing specialized industrial IoT applications. Onway AG is interested in providing an elegant solution for public transport fleets (e.g. buses) to gather low-level vehicle data and transmit them to a cloud-based system. This information can then be used to monitor the state of the vehicle and inform about possible issues in real time.
