\section{Punctuation}

\begin{Rule}
  Use opening (`) and closing (') quotation marks correctly.
\end{Rule}

In \LaTeX, the closing quotation mark is typed like a normal
apostrophe, while the opening quotation mark is typed using the French
\emph{accent grave} on your keyboard (the \emph{accent grave} is the
one going down, as in \emph{fr√®re}).
