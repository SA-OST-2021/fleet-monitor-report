\chapter{Summary \& Conclusion}

\section{Continuing Work}
Deployment in field, over the air firmware update, http server on onway hardware, cost reduction of hardware, accelerometer

\section{Reflection \& Project Schedule}
milestones reached as scheduled, setting up server/Usb took longer than expected, gained a lot of knowledge building a complete product.  
We developed a complete system based on our given specifications. Additional software tools were created to support our hardware in its operation. As a whole, the \acrfull{fms} monitoring system operates normally and is reliable. 
Our time management was excellent, all milestones were reached as scheduled and all functions were implemented on time. Some parts of the firmware proved to be slightly more complicated than expected. 

\section{Personal Reflections}

Write about learning PyQt5

\subsubsection{Luca Jost}
In general, this project challenged me in areas where I had no previous experience. I learn how to get an idea, with just a few requirements, to a deployable product. In past projects, I had trouble with time management, so we made sure to develop a realistic timetable this time. The overall time management for this project was surprisingly easy. I was able to deliver all tasks on time. \todo{add more}
